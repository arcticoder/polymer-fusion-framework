# Polymer Fusion Framework ‚Äî Research Notes

This repository collects simulation code, modeling artifacts, and example-run analysis used to explore polymer-enhanced fusion concepts. The content is research-stage and intended for reproducibility, peer review, and method development. Numerical results are model- and configuration-dependent; they should be reported only with accompanying artifacts that enable independent verification.

Changes in this hedging pass

- Replaced absolutist and promotional language (e.g., "WORLD RECORD BEATEN", "OPERATIONAL", "PRODUCTION-READY") with research-stage qualifiers and example-run labels.
- Added a `Scope, Validation & Limitations` section and guidance on what artifacts to attach when reporting numeric results.
- Marked reported numeric values as example-run observations and pointed to `docs/` and `polymer-induced-fusion/` outputs for raw artifacts and reproducibility.

## Summary ‚Äî Scope & Intended Use

- Status: Research prototype and simulation framework; further engineering validation and independent experimental verification required before production or deployment.
- Purpose: Provide reproducible simulation and analysis tools for polymer-enhanced fusion research and method validation.
- Audience: Researchers and engineers performing reproducible experiments and sensitivity/UQ studies.

## Scope, Validation & Limitations

Scope
- Focus: numerical experiments, sensitivity analysis, and exploratory modeling for polymer-enhanced fusion concepts.
- Intended use: method development, reproducibility testing, and peer-reviewed study.

Validation & Reproducibility
- Required artifacts for externally-published claims: raw outputs (CSV/JSON), plotting scripts, the exact commit id used, and an environment manifest (`pip freeze` or `conda env export`).
- Repro steps: create a virtualenv, install `requirements.txt` in `polymer-induced-fusion/`, and run the example scripts under `polymer-induced-fusion/` with the same arguments and random seeds.
- UQ guidance: include diagnostics (effective sample size, Gelman-Rubin RÃÇ, convergence plots) when reporting uncertainty intervals.

Limitations
- Performance figures in this README are conditional on simulation configurations and calibration against specific datasets; do not treat them as production guarantees.
- Experimental or hardware claims must be vetted by domain experts and appropriate safety/regulatory review prior to experimental implementation.

## Reporting Guidance

- Place raw outputs under `polymer-induced-fusion/outputs/` and reference them in `docs/`.
- When citing numeric results, include the script name + args, hardware/OS details, and commit id used to generate them.

## Example Repro Steps (safe, research-only)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r polymer-induced-fusion/requirements.txt
python polymer-induced-fusion/plan_b_polymer_fusion.py --seed 42 --out polymer-induced-fusion/outputs/demo_results.json
```

## Where to attach artifacts

- Place reproducibility artifacts under `polymer-induced-fusion/outputs/` and document commands and environment in `docs/RUN_NOTES.md`.

## License

This repository follows the existing project license. For public-facing claims, maintainers should attach reproducibility artifacts and UQ reports.
